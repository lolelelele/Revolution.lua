# What is Revolution.lua
Revolution.lua is a menu base prepared with another perspective.
It has been developed in the most convenient way to Lua language, as a noob friendly.
It is very easy to create new menus because it uses array-based indexable design architecture instead of nested scripting.
Revolution.lua is not a standalone menu. In my spare time, I designed it in a way that I can easily add a troll option. Usage and menu making is simple and easy. Fully open to development!


# Benefits
You won't have to deal with nested queries in a scripting language like lua. And make sure this will make your job easier than you guessed.
Cleaner and readable coding as the layout is designed independently

# Drawbacks

Automatically indexes the order of the submenus. It is bad for user memorization.
Checkboxes and comboboxes are not available in the main menu
